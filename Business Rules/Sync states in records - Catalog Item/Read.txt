The purpose of these scripts is sync the field 'state': sc_task, sc_req_item and the field 'request_state': sc_request.


I assumed that the catalog item is using the Flow instead of Workflow. May works, but I didn't tested. 

For the scripts to work correctly, some modifications must be made in the Flow of each catalog item.

For each catalog item with sctak (asynchronous or synchronous), the flow has to be analyzedor following each one of the premises below:

 - An action of the kind 'Update Record' should be add at the end of ALL sctask(s). It's can be replaced adding the stage 'Completed' on the flow instead;
 - If the sctask doesn't have the checkbox 'wait' checked, it's needed add an 'Wait for Condition' action.


Action (Updated Record):
   - Action: Update record
   - Record: Trigger -> Requested Item Record
   - Table: sc_req_item
   - Fields: Stage | Completed

Action (Wait for a Condition):
   - Record: (drag and drop the sctask)
   - Table: sc_task
   - Conditions: Active is false
